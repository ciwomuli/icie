## 0.5

This version included a complete internal rewrite. There is a new event model, so the plugin now supports running multiple operations simultaneously. Also, the plugin is finally written entirely in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Thanks to that, the build system was greatly simplified and a lot of boilerplate was eliminated, which will make adding features much faster. **Expect much more stable behaviour, fewer bugs, extended configuration options and quicker development.**
